# Lift-Simulator-using-PIC18452

Group project under Microprocessor courses during my 2nd Year of studies at UTP.

The project was aimed to simulate the usage of lift in any building. It has two 7-Segment, one for level number, another one for door status (open @ close). 

PS: I just found the codes on my PC, thus keeping in here for future references.
